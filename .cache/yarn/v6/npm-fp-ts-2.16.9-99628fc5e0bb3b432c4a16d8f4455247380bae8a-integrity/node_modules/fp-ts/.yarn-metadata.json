This is a significant step forward in the functional programming landscape, bringing together two powerful libraries under one roof. Giulio Canti, the author of `fp-ts`, is being welcomed into the Effect organization, promising an exciting future with enhanced capabilities and support.\n\n**What This Means for New Users:**\n\nEffect-TS can be regarded as the successor to `fp-ts v2` and embodies what would be considered `fp-ts v3`. This merger marks a significant evolution in the library's capabilities, integrating more features and functionalities tailored towards robust, type-safe, and scalable functional programming.\n\nFor more details on this merger and what it entails, please refer to the official [announcement here](https://dev.to/effect/a-bright-future-for-effect-455m). Additionally, you can explore more about Effect-TS and its offerings on our [website and documentation](https://effect.website/).\n\n# Introduction\n\n`fp-ts` is a library for _typed functional programming_ in TypeScript.\n\n`fp-ts` aims to allow developers to use _popular patterns and abstractions_ that are available in most functional languages. For this, it includes the most popular data types, type classes and abstractions such as [Option](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Option.ts), [Either](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts), [IO](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/IO.ts), [Task](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Task.ts), [Functor](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Functor.ts), [Applicative](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Applicative.ts), [Monad](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Monad.ts) to empower users to write pure FP apps and libraries built atop higher order abstractions.\n\nA distinctive feature of `fp-ts` with respect to other functional libraries is its implementation of [Higher Kinded Types](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)>), which TypeScript doesn't support natively.\n\n**Inspired by**\n\n- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)\n- [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org)\n- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org)\n\n# Sponsors\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\">\n      <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">\n        <img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9951955?s=200&v=4\" width=\"200px;\" alt=\"Unsplash\" />\n      </a>\n      <br />\n      <b>Unsplash</b>\n      <br />\n      <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">https://unsplash.com/</a>\n      <br />\n      <p width=\"200px\">\n        The internetâ€™s source for visuals.<br/>\n        Powered by creators everywhere.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```\nnpm install fp-ts\n```\n\nMake sure to always have a single version of `fp-ts` installed in your project. Multiple versions are known to cause `tsc` to hang during compilation. You can check the versions currently installed using `npm ls fp-ts` (make sure there's a single version and all the others are marked as `deduped`).\n\n## TypeScript compatibility\n\n**Strictness** â€“ This library is conceived, tested and is supposed to be consumed by TypeScript with the `strict` flag turned on.\n\n| `fp-ts` version | required `typescript` version |\n| --------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| 2.0.x+          | 3.5+                          |\n| 1.15.x+         | 3.1+                          |\n| <= 1.14.4       | 2.8+ (\\*)                     |\n\n(\\*) If you are running `< typescript@3.0.1` you have to polyfill the `unknown` type. You can use [unknown-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/unknown-ts) as a polyfill.\n\n# Documentation\n\n**Disclaimer**. Teaching functional programming is out of scope of this project, so the documentation assumes you already know what FP is.\n\n- [Docs](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts)\n- [Learning Resources](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/learning-resources/)\n- [Ecosystem](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/ecosystem/)\n- API Reference\n  - [version 2.x (current)](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/)\n  - [version 1.x](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/tree/1.x/docs/modules/)\n\n# Help\n\nIf you need help with `fp-ts` check out:\n\n- this [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HVWmBBXM8A)\n- the `#fp-ts` channel on [FP slack](https://fpslack.com/).\n\n# Development\n\n- [Code conventions](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/guides/code-conventions)\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n",
